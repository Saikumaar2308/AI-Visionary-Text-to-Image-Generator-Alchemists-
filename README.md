* Text Input: Users input descriptive text into the system.
* Text Processing (NLP): The input text is processed using Hugging Face LLMs to generate embeddings that capture the text's meaning and context.
* Image Generation (GAN): The text embeddings are fed into a GAN (using Hugging Face’s Diffusers library) which generates an image based on the textual description.
* Output Image: The generated image is displayed to the user via the web interface, providing visual representation of the input text.
